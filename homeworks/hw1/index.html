        <h1><strong>Armelle</strong></h1>
        <p><em>Business Major - graduate student</em></p>
        <p>Hello !  My name is Armelle and I'm from France. I'm actually attending a diploma in Business and Entrepreneurship for one year at the Business Haas School of Business. I really love to practise different sports such as tennis and horse riding back in my home country. I really wanted to learn more about computer languages and I'm really excited about this Decal course to design websites on my own !</p>
        </p>
        <p>I've been living for one month in Berkeley now and I've been able to discover many places to eat after my courses, especially with friends. I am particulary fond of burgers and have found three places around the campus to enjoy this meal : 
            <ul>
                <li>Super Duper</li><li>Bunz</li><li>Bongo Burger</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

                <li>This article enabled me to undertand that design is a skill that needs to be studied to get a product sense. Having a design eye is not inate: it is necessary to focus on each component when building an app or a website for a customer. Thanks to this "Design-eye", customers will be more likely to spend time on the app, which will have a great impact on a business'growth.</li>
                <li>My favourite part of the article was about the four keys given to better create apps. By describing those components, it enables us to truly understand their importance even if we are aware that apps are built to attract us. However, this quick review reminds us that even simple things can really attract customers if they are well used.</li>
                <li>"When I started off in design, I sucked".</li>
                <li>I would rate this lecture experience a 7. The information given are very instructive. Thus, it would be interesting to have deeper explanations and more examples to better understand the design work. </li>
